The original version shows suggestions based on the topic of your search and keeps track of most searched topics and history for convenience. 
Zearch+ searches through over 20k stored links to have accurate results and information based on what you search. No information about your searches is stored at all, and it will warn you about potentially dangerous results, however, it does not have some of the convenient sharing features as the original version.
